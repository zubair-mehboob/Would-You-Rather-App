# Would You Rather

Web app version of the game *"Would You Rather?"*
developed as part of the [Udacity React Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/react-nanodegree--nd019).

The primary purpose for developing [Would You Rather](https://would-you-rather-reactnd.herokuapp.com/) was to gain
exposure to React & Redux, thus core functionality such as
user authentication and the project backend is mocked.
As a result you will notice that data
